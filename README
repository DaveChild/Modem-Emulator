Model Emulator

Description
    Plenty of users don't have the same high speeds you might be used to. The use of mobile devices to browse the web is on the rise, and there are still people on dial-up modems out there. It's all too easy to forget that when you're surfing on a high speed office connection or even your home broadband. This modem emulator is intended to provide a tool for webmasters to see their sites as some of their users do - slowly.
